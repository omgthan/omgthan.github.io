                        <p>I recently (May 2025) graduated from the University of Kansas with a
                            Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I finished a 3.710 cumulative GPA
                            and appearing on KU's engineering honor roll (minimum requirement of
                            3.75 semester GPA across 12 graded credit hours) in four of my eight
                            semesters in the school.
                        </p>
                        <p>While I didn't have a particular focus of study
                            within the field, some of the CS electives I took that I found
                            particularly interesting were Compiler Construction (EECS 665), Software
                            Reverse Engineering (EECS 695), Digital Systems Design (EECS 443), and
                            Programming Languages (EECS 662). Some non-CS classes I enrolled in
                            that I took interest in included Greek and Roman Mythology (CLSX 148),
                            Introductory Linguistics (ANTH 106), Contemporary Astronomy (ASTR 191),
                            and Language and Mind (LING 110).
