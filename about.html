                        <h2 class="section-heading">Education</h1>
                        <p>I recently (May 2025) graduated from the University of Kansas with a
                            Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I finished a 3.710 cumulative GPA
                            and appearing on KU's engineering honor roll (minimum requirement of
                            3.75 semester GPA across 12 graded credit hours) in four of my eight
                            semesters in the school.
                        </p>
                        <p>While I didn't have a particular focus of study
                            within the field, some of the CS electives I took that I found
                            particularly interesting were Compiler Construction (EECS 665), Software
                            Reverse Engineering (EECS 695), Digital Systems Design (EECS 443), and
                            Programming Languages (EECS 662). Some non-CS classes I enrolled in
                            that I took interest in included Greek and Roman Mythology (CLSX 148),
                            Introductory Linguistics (ANTH 106), Contemporary Astronomy (ASTR 191),
                            and Language and Mind (LING 110).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Interests</h1>
                        <p>My studies weren't narrowed to one particular area within computer science,
							but I did find myself more intrigued working with lower-level code. I found
							Digital Logic design and Embedded Systems (EECS 388) to be interesting because I was
							writing code (in VHDL and C, respectively) and seeing it work on a tangible device.
							I found Compiler Construction and Software Reverse Engineering interesting because I
							could see the inner workings of a compiler, understanding both how a program was compiled
							into an even lower-level language (x64) and how the assembly code itself functions.
						</p>
						<p>The interest I took in some of the non-CS electives I was in stems from an enjoyment that
							I already have in those subjects. I'm not a huge nerd in any of these topics, but I do
							enjoy learning about Greek and Roman mythology, space, and linguistics. I also love
							basketball, and I try to watch every Kansas Jayhawks basketball game.
						</p>
						<p>My biggest hobby, though, is playing video games, and they are the main reason I fell in
							love with coding. Growing up, I was enamored with the idea of one day being able to make
							my own, and I became inspired to learn how to program so I can bring my ideas to fruition.
							As I got older, and especially as I started at college, this expanded from making video games
							to programming anything. Coding became my outlet to create, with the keyboard as my paintbrush
							and the computer as my canvas.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Experience</h1>
                        <p>While I am still in the search for my first programming position, I do at least have prior
                            work experience with part time jobs, from which I have learned valuable skills in both
                            leadership and teamwork, directing coworkers and collaborating with team members to
                            operate as efficiently as possible. I have also learned the importance of time management
                            and prioritizing and addressing customer concerns.
                        </p>
                        <p>My programming experience is primarily in C/C++ and Python. I have also spent some time
                            programming with HTML, JavaScript, and SQL. My experience with these comes mostly from
                            classes I took while at KU, as well as brief interactions with Haskell and Racket. Outside
                            of school work, I have put major focus into learning GDScript, the scripting language used
                            in the Godot game engine.
                        </p>
